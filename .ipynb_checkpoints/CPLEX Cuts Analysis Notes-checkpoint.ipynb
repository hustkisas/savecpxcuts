    "### How frequent a cut appear in mutiple instances? \n",
    "We assume that, CPLEX keeps useful cuts at the end of root node solving. If each instance has a distinct set of cuts at the end, then it might not be that beneficial to reuse the cuts in a new instance. We hope to find sets of cuts are used for a certain group of instances. If this is true, we could proceed to predict the set of cuts that will be useful in a new instance. \n",
    "### How many of them are valid across all instances? \n",
    "Can we identify a set of cuts that are always valid for all instances from the same systems? Note that, being valid doesn't mean being useful. "
